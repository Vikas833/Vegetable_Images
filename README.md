Vegetable Name Recognition Project


The Vegetable Name Recognition Project leverages the power of neural networks to accurately identify vegetables from an image dataset. With the growing need for efficient food classification in various fields, such as smart kitchens, agriculture, and supply chain management, this project focuses on recognizing 15 commonly used vegetables:

Bean, Bitter Gourd, Bottle Gourd, Brinjal, Broccoli, Cabbage, Capsicum, Carrot, Cauliflower, Cucumber, Papaya, Potato, Pumpkin, Radish, and Tomato.

The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning architecture particularly suited for image recognition tasks. By training the model on a curated dataset of vegetable images, the system learns to extract key visual features such as shape, texture, and color to distinguish between these vegetables.

This application has potential uses in automated grocery checkout systems, meal preparation assistants, and educational tools, providing an efficient solution for vegetable identification from images.
